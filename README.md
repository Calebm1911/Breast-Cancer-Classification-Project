Breast Cancer Classification Project
Overview
This project focuses on the classification of breast cancer using various machine learning models. The Breast Cancer dataset from sklearn is utilized to train and evaluate different classifiers, providing insights into their performance for cancer diagnosis.

Dataset
The Breast Cancer dataset includes features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. The goal is to predict whether the tumor is malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous).

Models Explored
Perceptron
Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machines (SVM) with Linear and Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernels
Decision Trees with Gini and Entropy criteria
Random Forests with Gini and Entropy criteria
K Nearest Neighbors
Naive Bayes
Workflow
Data loading and preprocessing
Standardization of features
Initialization and training of various classification models
Evaluation of model accuracies on both training and testing datasets
Results
The project provides insights into the performance of different machine learning models for breast cancer classification. Accuracies on training and testing datasets are reported for each model.
